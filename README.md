# Snake Game using Pygame 🎮

A classic snake game implemented in Python using the `pygame` library. This game is a simple yet fun way to explore the basics of game development in Python.

## How to Play 🐍
- Use the **arrow keys** to control the direction of the snake.
- The goal is to eat the blue square (food) to make the snake grow longer.
- The game ends if the snake hits the wall or its own body.

## Features ✨
- **Smooth Movement**: The snake responds to keyboard inputs in real-time.
- **Food Consumption**: Each time the snake eats food, its length increases.
- **Score Tracking**: Your score increases with each piece of food consumed and is displayed in real-time.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game window.

## Requirements 🛠️
To run the game, you need:
- **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
- The `pygame` library, which you can install using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```
